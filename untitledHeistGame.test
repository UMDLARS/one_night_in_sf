# Each line beginning with > is a command, and everything else marks expected
# output.

# 1. Lines starting with "!" are negated
# 2. Lines starting with "/" are regular expressions (mostly handy for
#    substring search). 
# 3. Lines starting with "*" name a test suite, starting the game over from the
#    beginning.
# 
# For the rest of the syntax, see the URL above.  In particular you may find
# >{include} testname
# syntax helpful for starting a suite of tests from the same point in the game.
