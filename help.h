		"^^This game was built with PunyInform,
		which is a system designed to recreate
		the ~Interactive Fiction~ games of Infocom.
		These games use a simple parser
		to split your typed instructions
		into verbs,
		prepositions,
		and objects.
		^^You will need to enter instructions
		beginning with imperative verbs,
		as though you were giving orders 
		to the character you are playing in the game.
		As examples,
		let's begin with movement verbs:^",
		"^    ", (ul) "north", "/", (ul) "n",
		" ", (ul) "south", "/", (ul) "s",
		" ", (ul) "east", "/", (ul) "e",
		" ", (ul) "west", "/", (ul) "w",
		" ", (ul) "up", "/", (ul) "u",
		" ", (ul) "down", "/", (ul) "d",
		"^^These are all shortcuts
		for the verb ", (ul) "go", ".
		So typing ", (ul) "s", " or ", (ul) "south", 
		" is the same as entering ", (ul) "go south",
		".  Here are some other verbs:^",
		"^    ", (ul) "look", "/", (ul) "l",
		" -- Display the description of your character's current location, and list any obvious items there.",
		"^    ", (ul) "inventory", "/", (ul) "i",
		" -- List all of the objects your character is carrying.",
		"^    ", (ul) "again", "/", (ul) "g",
		" -- Repeat the last instruction.",
		"^    ", (ul) "quit", "/", (ul) "q",
		" -- Quit the game (you'll be asked for confirmation).",
		"^    ", (ul) "restart", 
		" -- Start the game over from the beginning.",
		"^    ", (ul) "undo", 
		" -- Undo the last instruction.",
		"^^Most verbs accept nouns
		as objects of their actions.
		Here are some useful verbs
		that act on direct objects:^",
		"^    ", (ul) "get", "/", (ul) "take", "/", (ul) "pick up", (bf) " object",
		" -- Pick up an object so that your character carries it around.",
		"^    ", (ul) "drop", "/", (ul) "discard", (bf) " held object",
		" -- Leave an object in your character's current location.",
		"^    ", (ul) "look at", "/", (ul) "examine", "/", (ul) "x", (bf) " object",
		" -- Display the description of the object you specify, if it's visible.",
		"^    ", (ul) "open", "/", (ul) "uncover", "/", (ul) "unwrap", (bf) " object",
		" -- Open a thing that can be opened or closed, such as a door or a box.",
		"^    ", (ul) "close", "/", (ul) "cover", "/", (ul) "shut", (bf) " object",
		" -- Close something that is open.",
		"^    ", (ul) "climb", "/", (ul) "scale", (bf) " object",
		" -- Climb up an object to reach somewhere else.",
		"^^Some instructions require you to specify
		an indirect object,
		which is used to complete the action:^",
		"^    ", (ul) "say", "/", (ul) "answer", "/", (ul) "shout", (bf) " topic ", (ul) "to", (bf) " listener",
		" -- Say something to a listening object or character in the game.",
		"^    ", (ul) "unlock", "/", (ul) "pry", "/", (ul) "force open", (bf) " object ", (ul) "with", (bf) " held object",
		" -- Change a stuck or locked object, so that you can ", (ul) "open", " it.",
		"^    ", (ul) "hit", "/", (ul) "smash", "/", (ul) "break", (bf) " object ", (ul) "with", (bf) " held object",
		" -- Apply force to one object with another.",
		"^^Note that some verbs
		do very different things
		depending on the rest of the sentence:^",
		"^    ", (ul) "throw", (bf) " held object",
		" -- The same as ", (ul) "drop", ".",
		"^    ", (ul) "throw", "/", (ul) "put", (bf) " held object ", (ul) "in", (bf) " container", 
		" -- Put an object inside another.",
		"^    ", (ul) "throw", (bf) " held object ", (ul) "at", (bf) " object", 
		" -- Throw one object at another.",
		"^^Useful objects will tell you
		which verbs to use:^",
		"^    ", (ul) "help", "/", (ul) "use", (bf) " object", 
		" -- Print brief help text about interacting with an item.";
